  "name": "Nature Power/Secret Power",
  "flavor": "Using the battlefield to it's fullest!",
  "text": "The Pokémon absorbs and redirects the properties of its environment onto the target. In the case of Nature Power, the move also changes type accordingly at storyteller’s discretion.\n- Close to a Building:\n> Redirect the electric current to inflict Paralysis. Electric-type.\n- Close to a Cave:\n> Redirect the rubble to hit and Flinch the foe. Rock-type.\n- Close to a Desert or Road:\n> Rediret the dust on the terrain to Reduce 1 success from the Accuracy rolls of the target. Ground-type.\n- Close to Grass:\n> Redirect the bug and grass powder left in the terrain to inflict Sleep. Grass-type.\n- Close to Snow:\n> Redirect the cold wind to Freeze the Foe. Ice-type.\n- Close to Water:\n> Redirect a pool of water to engulf the foe, reducing 1 point to their Strength as it tries to fight underwater. Water-type\nIn the end, what effect or type these moves have are the GM's choice and this is moreso a guide to what makes sense. Just make sure it generally makes sense with the location and all is good.",
  "example": "Shroomish uses Nature power in an abandoned building, this turns the move into Electric as it used the electricity from outlets to power it.\n\nAudino uses Secret Power inside a cave causing a stalactite to drop and make their opponent flinch."
