    "description": "This Pokemon mimics the special characteristics of others, making them look as if they were its own.",
    "effect": "During initiative the User copies the ability of a chosen Ally or of one Foe at random. This effect ends if the User faints or is removed from combat and may be reset on subsequent rounds. Some Abilities can't be copied (either for selection among allies, and are not added to the pool for random selection of a Foe). This Ability cannot be swapped or copied (ignoring the effects of Skill Swap, Trace etc.)"
