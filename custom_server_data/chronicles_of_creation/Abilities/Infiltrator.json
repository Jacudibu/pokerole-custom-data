    "name": "Infiltrator",
    "description": "The Pokemon is very stealthy with its movements. It is naturally harder to detect than others.",
    "effect": "This Pokemon's moves ignore Shield Moves and any active Screen Moves on the target's side of the battlefield. This Pokemon may choose to directly target an opponent who is behind a decoy (ex: Substitute/Shed Tail) damaging moves used this way do not affect the decoy."
