    "description": "The Pokemon naturally produces light through its body. Other Pokemon approach curiously when they see this light.",
    "effect": "The User and their allies are unaffected by negative Accuracy Stat Changes (They still suffer from Multi-Hit Move Accuracy Penalties as well as Shield Move penalties). When the User performs a move remove 1 Success from targets taking the Dodge action. If the User is Luminary Rank or Higher, remove 2 Successes instead."
