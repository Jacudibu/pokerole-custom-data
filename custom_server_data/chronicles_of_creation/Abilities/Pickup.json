    "name": "Pickup",
    "description": "This Pokémon has a knack for finding objects while out and about that others tend to miss.",
    "effect": "At the end of a scene, at GM discretion (such as after completing a battle, or at the end of the quest), roll 2d6. The reward table for this move can be found using the /rule command. In addition, once per battle, this pokemon may roll Chance Dice equal to their Rank. If this roll succeeds, they gain a temporary Consumable Item. The GM Picks the consumable item, rarity limited by rank. (Initiate and Acolyte can find Uncommon, Luminary and Paragon can find Rare, and High Priest(ess) can find Very Rare.)"
