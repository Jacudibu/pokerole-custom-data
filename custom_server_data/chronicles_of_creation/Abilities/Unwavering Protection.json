    "name": "Unwavering Protection",
    "description": "When chaos reigns and order is broken, He will appear to restore the balance.",
    "effect": "Followers of Zygarde may call upon 'Unwavering Protection' once per quest as a bonus action at any point during the combat round, allowing them to cast Protect on an ally to shield them from an incoming attack. This does not incur the shield move penalty, and is unaffected by it. At Luminary, gain 2 uses. At Paragon, gain 3."
