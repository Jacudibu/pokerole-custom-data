    "effect": "Devotees of the Forebears of Thought may call upon 'Guardian's Will' prior to embarking on a quest, allowing them to raise their Insight stat by 1. This confers all the same bonuses that come with it, including an extra moveslot and Will point, and potentially increasing Sp. Defense. At Luminary, raise a social stat and attack stat by 1. At High Priest(ess), raise any stat by 1."
