    "name": "Storm Control",
    "description": "The heavens are a raging tempest that may only be calmed by the stillness in the sky serpent's heart.",
    "effect": "Followers of Rayquaza may call upon 'Storm Control' once per quest as a bonus action during their combat turn, allowing them to cast a weather of their choice. This weather can still be overridden, and ties should still be rolled in the case of an already active weather. At Luminary, the user can choose to have either: 1) Only their allies benefit from the positive effects of the weather, or 2) Only their enemies get the adverse effects of the weather. At High Priest(ess), they gain both benefits."
